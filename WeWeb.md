# Datagrid
## Readonly/Edit States
1. In the editor, `editable` is the default state.
2. So, style each cell in the row to look editable.
3. Then, add a `readonly` state and style each element to look read-only.
4. The state will automatically be set by the datagrid component as the 'edit' pencil is clicked.

## Checkbox Component
