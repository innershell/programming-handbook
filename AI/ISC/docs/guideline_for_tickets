# Guideline: Tickets

This document outlines how to create and edit tickets for managing and tracking software changes.

## Major Changes

Use tickets for large, complex software changes that require organized thought and thorough peer reviews so that tickets can be fed into the AI agent for code development and post-development updates to documentation for accuracy.

## Minor Changes

Tickets are not necessary for smaller changes where the AI agent can be quickly prompted with the required changes. However, the AI agent must always update the documentation post-development for accuracy.
