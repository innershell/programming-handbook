# stack

```xs
stack {
  var $counter {
    value = 0
  }
  for (3) {
    each as $index {
      math.add $counter {
        value = 1
      }
    }
  }
  debug.log {
    value = $counter
  }
}
```

A `stack` block defines a sequence of actions to be executed in a specific context, such as within a `query`, `function`, `task`, or other block (e.g., `group`, `transaction`). It acts as a container for operations like:

- Variable declarations (e.g., `var`),
- Control flow (e.g., `for`, `conditional`),
- Function calls (e.g., `math.add`, `debug.log`),
- Database operations (e.g., `db.query`).

Stacks are used to organize and execute a series of steps in a structured manner, often as part of a larger workflow.

# input

```xs
input {
  text username filters=trim {
    description = "User's login name"
    sensitive = false
  }
  int age? {
    description = "User's age (optional)"
  }
}
```

An `input` block defines the parameters expected by a `query` or `function`. It includes:

- Fields with their data types (e.g., `text`, `int`),
- Optional status (marked with `?`),
- Filters (e.g., `trim`) to process the input,
- Metadata like `description` for clarity or `sensitive` to mark private data.

here is the list of accepted types:

- int
- timestamp
- text
- uuid
- vector
- date
- bool
- decimal
- email
- password
- json
- image
- video
- audio
- attachment

Inputs specify the data that a query or function can receive and work with, such as user-provided values in an API request.

# schema

```xs
schema {
  int customer_id
  text full_name filters=trim {
    description = "Customer's full name"
  }
  email contact_email filters=trim|lower {
    description = "Customer's email address"
    sensitive = true
  }
  timestamp registered_at?=now
}
```

A `schema` block, used within a `table` file, defines the structure of a database table. It includes:

- Fields with their data types (e.g., `int`, `text`, `email`),
- Optional status (marked with `?`),
- Default values (e.g., `?=now`),
- Filters (e.g., `trim|lower`) to process field values,
- Metadata like `description` for clarity or `sensitive` to mark private fields.

Schemas outline the columns and their properties for storing data in a table.

# response

```xs
response = $user_data
```

A `response` block, used within a `query` or `function`, specifies the data to return as the result of the operation. The value parameter defines the output, which can be a variable (e.g., `$user_data`), a literal, or an expression. Responses determine what data is sent back to the caller, such as API response data or a function’s return value.

# schedule

```xs
schedule {
  events = [
    {starts_on: 2025-01-01 09:00:00+0000, freq: 86400},
    {starts_on: 2025-01-02 09:00:00+0000, freq: 604800, ends_on: 2025-12-31 09:00:00+0000}
  ]
}
```

A `schedule` block, used within a `task` file, defines when the task should run. It includes an `events` array with:

- `starts_on`: The start date and time (e.g., `2025-01-01 09:00:00+0000`),
- `freq`: The frequency in seconds for recurring tasks (e.g., `86400` for daily, `604800` for weekly),
- `ends_on`: An optional end date for recurring tasks (e.g., `2025-12-31 09:00:00+0000`).

Schedules automate task execution at specified intervals or times.

# table

```xs
table "customer" {
  auth = true
  schema {
    int id
    text name filters=trim {
      description = "Customer's full name"
    }
    email email filters=trim|lower {
      description = "Customer's email address"
      sensitive = true
    }
    timestamp signup_date?=now
    bool is_active?=true
  }
  index = [
    {type: "primary", field: [{name: "id"}]}
    {type: "gin", field: [{name: "xdo", op: "jsonb_path_op"}]}
    {type: "btree", field: [{name: "email", op: "desc"}]}
  ]
}
```

A `table` file defines the schema for a database table (e.g., `customer`). It includes:

- An `auth` flag to enable/disable authentication for the table,
- A `schema` block listing fields with their data types (e.g., `int`, `text`, `email`), optional status (marked with `?`), default values (e.g., `?=now`), filters (e.g., `trim|lower`), and metadata like `description` or `sensitive`,
- An `index` block defining indexes for efficient querying (e.g., `primary` for the `id` field, `unique` for the `email` field).

Tables are used to structure and store data in a database, such as customer information.

# query

```xs
query /products verb=GET {
  input {
    text category filters=trim {
      description = "Product category to filter by"
      sensitive = false
    }
  }
  stack {
    var $category_filter {
      value = $input.category
    }
    conditional {
      if (`$category_filter|strlen > 0`) {
        db.query "product" {
          where = ($db.product.category|to_lower) == ($category_filter|to_lower)
        } as $filtered_products
      }
      else {
        db.query "product" {
        } as $filtered_products
      }
    }
  }
  response = $filtered_products
}
```

A `query` file defines an API endpoint to handle HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST). It includes:

- A path (e.g., `/products`) and HTTP method (`verb`),
- An `input` block to define request parameters (e.g., `category`), which can have filters (e.g., `trim`) and metadata like `description` or `sensitive`,
- A `stack` block containing the logic to process the request (e.g., querying a database, applying conditions),
- A `response` block specifying the data to return (e.g., `$filtered_products`).

Queries are essential for creating API endpoints to retrieve or manipulate data, such as fetching products by category.

# function

```xs
function "calculate_total" {
  input {
    int quantity?
    int price_per_item?
  }
  stack {
    var $total {
      value = 0
    }
    conditional {
      if (`$input.quantity == null || $input.price_per_item == null`) {
        throw {
          name = "InvalidInputError"
          value = "Quantity and price must be provided"
        }
      }
      else {
        math.mul $total {
          value = $input.quantity
        }
        math.mul $total {
          value = $input.price_per_item
        }
      }
    }
  }
  response = $total
}
```

A `function` file defines a reusable custom function that can be called elsewhere in your script. It includes:

- A name (e.g., `"calculate_total"`) to identify the function,
- An `input` block to define parameters (e.g., `quantity` and `price_per_item`), which can be optional (marked with `?`),
- A `stack` block containing the logic to execute (e.g., calculations, conditionals),
- A `response` block specifying the return value (e.g., `$total`).

Functions are ideal for encapsulating logic, such as calculating a total cost, that can be reused across scripts.

# task

```xs
task "daily_report" {
  stack {
    db.query "sales" {
      description = "Fetch daily sales data"
    } as $daily_sales
  }
  schedule = [
    {starts_on: 2025-01-01 08:00:00+0000, freq: 86400}
  ]
}
```

A `task` file defines a scheduled job that runs automatically at specified times. It includes:

- A name (e.g., `"daily_report"`) to identify the task,
- A `stack` block containing the actions to execute (e.g., querying a database),
- A `schedule` block with `events` to define when the task runs, including:
  - `starts_on`: The start date and time (e.g., `2025-01-01 08:00:00+0000`),
  - `freq`: The frequency in seconds for recurring tasks (e.g., `86400` for daily),
  - `ends_on`: An optional end date for recurring tasks (not used here).

Tasks are ideal for automating recurring operations like generating reports or syncing data.

# api.lambda

```xs
api.lambda {
  code = """
    // Javascript or Typescript code goes here
    return $input.value > 10 ? true : false;
  timeout = 10
  """
} as $result
```

allows you to run provided `code` in Javascript or Typescript in a sandboxed environment. Maximum execution time is `timeout` seconds.

The lambda function has access to your function stack context like `$input`, `$var`, `$auth` and `$env`.

The result of the execution is stored in `as $result` variable and is the returned value of the code.

# api.request

```xs
api.request {
  url = "https://api.example.com/users"
  method = "GET"
  params = {}|set:"user_id":"123"
  headers = []|push:"Authorization: Bearer token123"
  timeout = 30
} as $user_response
```

Sends an HTTP request to a specified URL and retrieves the response. It supports various HTTP methods, query parameters, custom headers, and a timeout to limit execution time. The response is stored in the variable specified by `as`.

# api.stream

```xs
api.stream {
  value = $processed_results
}
```

Streams data back to the client when the API response type is set to `'Stream'`. This is useful for real-time data delivery, such as in live updates or large data transfers.

# api.realtime_event

```xs
api.realtime_event {
  channel = "notifications_channel"
  data = $alert_message
  auth_table = "users"
  auth_id = "user_789"
}
```

Sends a real-time event over a specified channel, enabling live updates in applications. It includes a data payload and optional authentication details to control access.

# var

```xs
var $name {
  value = "value"
}
```

defines a variable with the name `$name` and the value `"value"`. The value can be a string, number, boolean, or an object followed by filters.

# var.update

```xs
var.update $name {
  value = "value"
}
```

updates the value of the variable with the name `$name` to `"value"`. The value can be a string, number, boolean, or an object followed by filters.

# array.find

```xs
array.find $customer_ages if (`$this > 18`) as $first_adult_age
```

Searches an array and returns the first element that meets the specified condition. If no element satisfies it, `null` is returned. The result is stored in the variable defined by `as`.

# array.push

```xs
array.push $shopping_cart {
  value = "oranges"
  disabled = false
  description = "Add oranges to cart"
}
```

Appends a new element to the end of an array. It accepts a `value` to add, with optional `disabled` (to skip execution) and `description` (for context or logging).

# array.unshift

```xs
array.unshift $priority_tasks {
  value = "urgent meeting"
}
```

Inserts a new element at the beginning of an array, shifting existing elements to higher indexes.

# array.shift

```xs
array.shift $waiting_list as $next_customer
```

Removes and returns the first element of an array, shortening the array by one. The removed element is stored in the variable specified by `as`.

# array.pop

```xs
array.pop $completed_tasks as $last_finished_task
```

Removes and returns the last element of an array, reducing its length by one. The removed element is stored in the variable defined by `as`.

# array.merge

```xs
array.merge $active_users {
  value = $new_users
}
```

Combines another array or a single value into the target array, appending all elements from the provided `value`.

# array.map

```xs
array.map ($json) {
  by = $this.email
} as $emails

array.map ($json) {
  by = {name: $this.name, gender: $this.gender}
} as $people
```

Transforms each element in an array using a specified expression defined in `by`. The resulting array is stored in the variable specified by `as`.

# array.partition

```xs
array.partition ($json) if ($this.gender == "male") as $is_male
```

Divides an array into two separate arrays based on a condition and stores the results in an object with a `true` and `false` key.

results look like:

```json
{
  "true": [
    /* elements matching condition */
  ],
  "false": [
    /* elements not matching condition */
  ]
}
```

# array.group_by

```xs
array.group_by ($users) {
  by = $this.gender
} as $user_by_gender
```

Groups elements in an array based on a specified key or expression defined in `by`.

# array.union

```xs

array.union ([1,3,5,7,9]) {
  value = [2,4,6,8]
  by = $this
} as $union
```

Combines two arrays into one, removing duplicate elements based on the expression defined in `by`.

# array.difference

```xs
// expects the result to be [1,3,5,7,9]
array.difference ([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) {
  value = [2,4,6,8]
  by = $this
} as $difference
```

Creates a new array containing elements from the original array that are not present in the provided `value` array, based on the expression defined in `by`.

# array.intersection

```xs
// expects the result to be [2,4,6]
array.intersection ([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]) {
  value = [2,4,6,8]
  by = $this
} as $intersection
```

Generates a new array containing only the elements that exist in both the original array and the provided `value` array, based on the expression defined in `by`.

# array.find_index

```xs
array.find_index $sale_prices if (`$this < 20`) as $first_discount_index
```

Returns the index of the first element that satisfies the condition. If no match is found, it returns `-1`. The result is stored in the variable specified by `as`.

# array.has

```

Creates a new array containing only the elements that meet the condition. The filtered result is stored in the variable specified by `as`.

# array.filter_count

```xs
array.filter_count $survey_responses if (`$this == "yes"`) as $yes_count
```

Counts how many elements in the array satisfy the condition. The total is stored in the variable defined by `as`.

Below is the documentation for the XanoScript functions related to database operations and control flow, as requested in your query. Each entry follows the style of the existing documentation, providing a code snippet example and a brief explanation of what the function does. The examples use meaningful variable names to illustrate practical use cases.

# conditional

```xs
conditional {
  if (`$user_age > 18`) {
    debug.log {
      value = "Adult user"
    }
  }
  elseif (`$user_age < 18`) {
    debug.log {
      value = "Minor user"
    }
  }
  else {
    debug.log {
      value = "User age not specified"
    }
  }
}
```

Controls the flow of the script based on specified conditions, allowing different code blocks to execute depending on whether the conditions are true or false. It functions like an if-else statement, checking each condition in sequence and running the corresponding block.

# continue

```xs
foreach $users as $user {
  if (`$user.age < 18`) {
    continue
  }
  debug.log {
    value = `$user.name + " is an adult"`
  }
}
```

Skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next one. This is useful for bypassing specific items in a loop based on a condition, such as skipping users under 18 in this example.

# db.add

```xs
db.add user {
  data = {
    name: $input.name,
    email: $input.email
  }
} as $new_user
```

Inserts a new record into a specified database table (e.g., `user`) with the provided data fields. The new record is stored in the variable specified by `as`, here `$new_user`, for further use.

# db.add_or_edit

```xs
db.add_or_edit user {
  field_name = "email"
  field_value = $input.email
  data = {
    name: $input.name,
    category: $input.category
  }
} as $user_record
```

Adds a new record to a database table (e.g., `user`) or updates an existing one based on a specified field (e.g., `email`) and its value (e.g., `$input.email`). The data block specifies the fields to add or update, and the resulting record is stored in `$user_record`.

# db.del

```xs
db.del comment {
  field_name = "id"
  field_value = $input.commentId
}
```

Removes a record from a database table (e.g., `comment`) based on a specified field (e.g., `id`) and its value (e.g., `$input.commentId`). This deletes the matching record.

# db.direct_query

```xs
db.direct_query {
  sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE users.email = ?"
  response_type = "list"
  arg = $input.email
} as $query_results
```

Executes a raw SQL query directly on the database, using placeholders (`?`) for parameters provided via `arg`. The `response_type` specifies whether to return a `list` or `single` result. The output is stored in the variable defined by `as`, here `$query_results`.

# db.edit

```xs
db.edit "user" {
  field_name = "email"
  field_value = $input.email
  data = {
    category: $input.category
  }
} as $updated_user
```

Updates an existing record in a database table (e.g., `user`) identified by a field (e.g., `email`) and its value (e.g., `$input.email`). The `data` block specifies the fields to update, and the revised record is stored in `$updated_user`.

# db.get

```xs
db.get "user" {
  field_name = "email"
  field_value = $input.email
} as $user
```

Retrieves a single record from a database table (e.g., `user`) based on a specified field (e.g., `email`) and its value (e.g., `$input.email`). The fetched record is stored in the variable specified by `as`, here `$user`.

# db.has

```xs
db.has "user" {
  field_name = "email"
  field_value = $input.email
} as $user_exists
```

Checks if a record exists in a database table (e.g., `user`) based on a specified field (e.g., `email`) and its value (e.g., `$input.email`). Returns `true` if found, `false` otherwise, stored in `$user_exists`.

# db.query

```xs
db.query "client" {
  description = "Fetch client details by name"
  where = $db.client.name contains $input.search
  sort = {name: "asc"}
  return = {
    type: "list"
    paging: {
      page: 1
      per_page: 25
    }
  }
} as $matched_client
```

The search variables accepts specific query filters, listed in the [Query Filters documentation](./query_filters.md).

Retrieves multiple records from a database table (e.g., `client`) based on a search condition. Here, it matches records where the client name contains the search input. The results are sorted by name in ascending order and include pagination. The results are stored in `$matched_client`.

```xs
db.query "availability" {
  sort = {created_at: "asc"}
  return = {
    type: "list"
    paging: {
      page: $input.page
      per_page: 20
    }
  }
} as $availability
```

Retrieves multiple records from a database table (e.g., `availability`) with sorting by creation date. The results include pagination using dynamic values from input parameters. The results are stored in `$availability`.

# db.schema

```xs
db.schema user {
  path = "email"
} as $email_schema
```

Returns the schema of a database table (e.g., `user`) or a specific field within it (e.g., `email` via `path`). The schema information is stored in the variable specified by `as`, here `$email_schema`.

# db.set_datasource

```xs
db.set_datasource {
  value = "test"
}
```

Changes the datasource for all subsequent database queries in the current script execution to the specified value (e.g., `"test"`). This affects all database operations that follow.

# db.transaction

```xs
db.transaction {
  description = "Update user and log action"
  stack {
    db.update user { /* ... */ }
    db.add log { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

Executes a series of database operations (e.g., updating a user and adding a log entry) within a single transaction. Ensures atomicity—either all operations succeed, or none are applied. The `description` provides context.

# db.truncate

```xs
db.truncate user {
  reset = true
}
```

Deletes all records from a specified database table (e.g., `user`). If `reset = true`, it also resets any auto-incrementing IDs, effectively clearing the table and starting fresh.

# db.external.mssql.direct_query

```xs
db.external.mssql.direct_query {
  sql = "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE orders.total > ?"
  response_type = "list"
  connection_string = "mssql://db_user:db_password@server.com:1433/sales_db?sslmode=disabled"
  arg = $input.min_total
} as $large_orders
```

Executes a SQL query directly on an external Microsoft SQL Server database. The `code` parameter contains the SQL statement, and `response_type` specifies whether it returns a `list` of records or a `single` record. The `connection_string` provides access to the database, and `arg` supplies values for placeholders (e.g., `?`) in the query. Results are stored in the variable defined by `as`, here `$large_orders`.

# db.external.mysql.direct_query

```xs
db.external.mysql.direct_query {
  sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE products.category = ?"
  response_type = "list"
  connection_string = "mysql://db_user:db_password@host.com:3306/inventory_db?sslmode=disabled"
  arg = $input.category
} as $category_products
```

Runs a SQL query directly on an external MySQL database. The `response_type` determines if the result is a `list` or a `single` record. The `connection_string` specifies the database connection, and `arg` provides values for query placeholders. The output is stored in the `as` variable, here `$category_products`.

# db.external.oracle.direct_query

```xs
db.external.oracle.direct_query {
  sql = "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employees.department = ?"
  response_type = "list"
  connection_string = "oracle://db_user:db_password@server.com:1521/hr_db"
  arg = $input.department
} as $department_employees
```

Directly executes a SQL query on an external Oracle database. The `response_type` sets whether the query returns a `list` or a `single` record. The `connection_string` defines the database connection, and `arg` supplies placeholder values. Results are stored in the variable specified by `as`, here `$department_employees`.

# db.external.postgres.direct_query

```xs
db.external.postgres.direct_query {
  sql = "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customers.last_purchase > ?"
  response_type = "list"
  connection_string = "postgres://db_user:db_password@host.com:5432/shop_db?sslmode=prefer"
  arg = $input.date_threshold
} as $recent_customers
```

Performs a SQL query directly on an external PostgreSQL database. The `response_type` indicates if the result is a `list` or a `single` record. The `connection_string` establishes the database connection, and `arg` provides values for placeholders. The results are stored in the `as` variable, here `$recent_customers`.

# debug.stop

```xs
debug.stop {
  value = $some_var
}
```

This function stops the script’s execution at the point where it’s called and sends the specified `value` to the debugger. It’s a handy tool for troubleshooting, allowing you to inspect the contents of a variable (like `$some_var`) during development to ensure your script is working as expected.

# foreach

```xs
foreach ($numbers_list) {
  each as $item {
    var.update $sum {
      value = `$sum + $item`
    }
  }
}
```

**Example with a predefined list**:

```xs
foreach ([1, 2, 3, 4]) {
  each as $item {
    var.update $sum {
      value = `$sum + $item`
    }
  }
}
```

The `foreach` function loops through every item in a list (e.g., an array like `$numbers_list` or `[1, 2, 3, 4]`). The `each as` clause assigns the current item to a variable (e.g., `$item`), which you can use inside the loop to perform actions on each element.

# for

```xs
for (10) {
  description = "Repeat this 10 times, with $index counting from 0 to 9"
  each as $index {
    debug.log {
      value = `$index + 1`
    }
  }
}
```

This function creates a loop that runs a set number of times (e.g., 10). The `each as` clause provides a counter variable (e.g., `$index`), which starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, up to one less than the specified number (e.g., 0 through 9 for a count of 10).

# function.run

```xs
function.run "add_fn" {
  input = { a: $input.a, b: $input.b }
} as $func_result
```
