# Project Structure

## File/Folder Naming Conventions

1. **Snake Case**: The standard for this project is to name files and folders in lowercase letters. Separate multiple words with an underscore character (`_`).
   - Note! There are exceptions where an IDE configuration file, extensions, or other external tools may require a different file/folder naming convention (e.g., `TNSNAMES.ora` for Oracle databases). Consult their respective manuals for the proper naming convention.
2. **Singular Nouns**: The preference is for files to use singular nouns.
3. **Plural Nouns**: The preference is for folders to use plural nouns.

## Project Folders

All projects should be setup with a standard folding structure for frontend, backend, docs, and testing as follows:
