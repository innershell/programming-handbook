# Ticket Instructions

- **Markdown**: Tickets are always markdown files.

- **Ticket Template**: ALWAYS use the [Ticket Template](../../docs/templates/template_for_tickets.md) for creating or updating a ticket.

- **Strictly Adhere to Template Sections**: ALWAYS adhere to the predefined sections and NEVER add new section headings that are not predefined in the Ticket Template. If an unknown section is found in the ticket, leave it alone. The predefined sections are:

  - **Description**: Quickly describe the change (enhancement, bug fix, etc.) in a few words.
  - **Requirements**: Describe **what** the user needs.
  - **Designs & Constraints**: describe **how** the needs are met and **why** specific decisions were made.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, verifiable conditions required to close the ticket.
