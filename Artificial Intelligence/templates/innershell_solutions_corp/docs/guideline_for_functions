# Guideline: Functions

This document outlines how to create and edit functions for business logic.

## Client-Side Functions

Reusable functions that execute on the client are defined in the `frontend\libs` folder.

## Server-Side Functions

This project currently does not use any backend services. All business logic is handled locally on the client.
